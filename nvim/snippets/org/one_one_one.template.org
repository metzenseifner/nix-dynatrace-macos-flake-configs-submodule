# From "The Coaching Habit"
# Awe Question
## And what else?
###  Avoid the "fake question": offering a choice with a question attached "have you thought of", offer an option, not a question.
###  Why: follow-up questions that promote higher level thinking deepen understanding and promote participation
###  When I've got the answer I wish to suggest, instead of asking "what about", I will ask one of the seven essential questions.

# Focus Question (stop solving the wrong problem, hone in on the right problem)
## What is the real challenge here for you?
### If you had to pick one of these to focus on, which one of these would be the real challenge for you? 
### Why: Avoid proliferations of challenges. "domino effect" Slow people down and think deeper. Dig down into low-level details. Pins it to that person, forcing person to wrestle with themselves.
