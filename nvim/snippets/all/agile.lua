  Cons
    - Loose planning can lead to unpredictable finished product and date slippage
    - The high level of collaboration may be difficult to maintain
    - It can become a relentless pace. It is important to find a sustainable workload
    - Continuous changes on a project can lead to project creep if not handled well
    - More time and commitment is required for all the involved parts (teams, stakeholders, etc.)
  Pros
    - Flexibility to respond to the market and new intelligence
    - The implementation team has room for creative problem solving
    - Self-organizing teams and resource allocation
    - Frequent updates and increased customer value
    - Rigid cadence, deadline flexibility
    - Teams are more empowered

  Manifesto for Agile Software Development from 2001 in Utah

  We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

  A) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  B) Working software over comprehensive documentation
  C) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  D) Responding to change over following a plan

  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
  through early and continuous delivery
  of valuable software.

  Welcome changing requirements, even late in
  development. Agile processes harness change for
  the customer's competitive advantage.

  Deliver working software frequently, from a
  couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
  preference to the shorter timescale.

  Business people and developers must work
  together daily throughout the project.

  Build projects around motivated individuals.
  Give them the environment and support they need,
  and trust them to get the job done.

  The most efficient and effective method of
  conveying information to and within a development
  team is face-to-face conversation.

  Working software is the primary measure of progress.

  Agile processes promote sustainable development.
  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
  to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

  Continuous attention to technical excellence
  and good design enhances agility.

  Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
  of work not done--is essential.

  The best architectures, requirements, and designs
  emerge from self-organizing teams.

  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
  to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
  its behavior accordingly.

Team CARE Daily Standup Meeting

Purpose -> Ensure Sprint goals can be reached
-	Share progress and challenges during the Sprint,
-	Keep everyone up-to-date about progress, impediments, possible/needed changes
-	Organize the Development Team to focus on and reach the Sprint goal.

Examples
-	Identify collaboration opportunities by way of “what are you working on”.
-	Anything that will bring value (otherwise skip details) from the previous working day?
-	Were you blocked yesterday by anything?
-	Would you like to request another set of eyes (pair programming)?
-	Should we schedule a synchronous or asynchronous “tech talk”?

Please keep it short and to the point.

We strive for alignment with the Value Creation Guide’s definition of this event/ceremony, while making it work for us.
See https://dynatrace.sharepoint.com/sites/RnD/SitePages/Events-%26-Alignment.aspx

Team CARE Daily Post Standup Meeting

Purpose -> Dedicated time slot for topics beyond the standup
-	Announcements (esp. from team captain regarding team-external matters)
-	Topics (tech discussions that will bring value) max. 30 min. else divert to a dedicated meeting, ideally with a ticket to book on.

We take advantage of the fact that everyone is together already, which means there is minimal overhead in planning a synchronous team meeting. To be respectful of each others’ time, you’re free to leave as not all discussions may be relevant for everyone.
